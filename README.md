# Company-crm
Built on flask framework with mongodb as database

This is three tier CRM.
Ex. There is a company named AHA3d. They have their distributors. And these distributors have the clients.
These distributors of company keep track of their clients. A table with (on running) editable contents and editable section for status of deal.
And the company admin can see the table of any distributor. 

For admin, type /admin to open it.

This is equipped with passwords and signup options. No chances to hack :P.
